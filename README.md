# Dad & Son

Windows Forms Application made in Visual Studio Community 2019 v16.7.6 and written in C# (.NET Framework v4.6.1).

Application is made for sole purpose of showing how to implement `game idea` and `code togheter` with my son, as well we write some functions using creative imagination :)

Used `all the things that we have` we coding in pairs.
